# TGEHub

TGEHub is a central hub for managing projects built with the TGE game engine. It simplifies the process of creating and organizing game projects while ensuring seamless integration with TGE.

## Installation

2. Inside the extracted folder, locate the Files directory.

3. Place your version of the TGE game engine inside the Files folder. The engine should be in a folder named TGE.
